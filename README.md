Fuck You CO₂. This is an arduino based project for hobby undergrounders. Its a cheap selfmade CO₂ Alert.

So a bit of a Disclaimer here: IF YOU BUILD THIS YOUR OWN YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT YOU ARE DOING. BE ADVISED: I NEVER USED IT WITHOUT PROPER SAFETY EQUIPMENT. DON'T USE IT AS YOUR ONLY LIFE SAVING APPARATUS OR YOU WILL DIE.
I mean.... You can use it (alone). But dont blame me if you die, your house gets on fire or your stupid ass girlfriend cheats on you. I warned you!

With that being said. I have not build it properly, nor have i calibrated or testet the sensor much. I will do this in the future tho and i am happy to risk my life for this kind of bullshit. Dont be me, be smart and dont do this.

So anybody willing to help is appreciated because if i start a project im gonna stop at exactly 75% and it sits around a fucking long time. So feel free to kick my ass if i forgott about this project.
This project is one of these but after sitting around on my bench for eone year halffinished, i want to do it right.


So about the project: Basiclly i am not going to spend 300+ Dollars for a piece of equipment i can build for hopefully less than 100$ with cute animated girls on the screen or some bullshit.(on wich my life depends ¯\_(ツ)_/¯).

So i grabbed this sensor https://sandboxelectronics.com/?product=mh-z16-ndir-co2-sensor-with-i2cuart-5v3-3v-interface-for-arduinoraspeberry-pi and a bit of other components like (ebay.de Names, you cant miss it when searching):
LCD Display Nokia 5110 84x48 PCD8544 Grafik Display grau / weiss Arduino 435
4 x 4 Membran Keypad Keyboard Tastatur Matrix 8pin Modul Arduino STM32
5x 5V Step-Up Boost Module Power Bank Lithium Battery Charging Protection Board

A 18650 Bat and holder + a few little stuff i will link when i need it.

Out of this im gonna build a CO₂-Meter wich SHOULD (!!!!!!) be able to warn you in High CO₂ Situations in abandoned mineworkings. Hopefully before you die. I cant stress this enough. Don't do what i am most likely gonna do (if its going to work).

So... This is one of my first arduino based bigger projects, that could interesst more than only myself. Never worked with GitHub before. So prepare yourself, this is gonna end badly.
